## Overview

Apple use Face ID as an unlocking method first in iPhone X, it use a bunch of technology to improve its performance.

* Front facing **depth-camera**
* **infrared camera**
* **Deep learning**

I was so interested in this tech especially how can Apple apply deep learning with little data and limited compute resource in mobile phone.

## How it Works?

Apple release a whitepaper about Face ID, so we can learn something from it.

The whole security system is called **TrueDepth camera system**

* **map the geometry** of your face
