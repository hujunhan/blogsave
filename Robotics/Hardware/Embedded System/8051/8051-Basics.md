## 1 Embedded System Introduction

> An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task

<!-- more -->

### 1.1 Architecture

* **Von Neumann**: data and code lie in the **same** memory blocks
* **Harvard**:             data and code lie in **different** memory blocks

### 1.2 Instruction Set

* CISC: Easy to use, higher clock cycle
* RISC: Hard to use, lower clock cycle

## 2 8051 Introduction

In 1981, Intel introduced an **8-bit** microcontroller called the **8051**. 

* 128 bytes of **RAM**
* 4K byte of on-chip **ROM** 
  * Max 64K at all because `PC` is 16-bit : (0000 to FFFF address)
* two **timers**
* 4 **ports** (8-bit wide)
* 3 internal and 2 external **Interrupts**
* Family Member
  * 8052: 8K ROM, 256 byte RAM, 3 Timer
  * 8031: 0K ROM, 128 byte RAM, 2 Timer

### 2.1 Registers

|   Registers    |                           Meaning                            |
| :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   `A`(8-bit)   |         accumulator: quick. Used for all operations          |
|   `R`(8-bit)   |            R0,R1 to R7: store values temporarily             |
| `DPTR`(16-bit) |             Data Pointer: access external memory             |
|  `PC`(16-bit)  | Program Counter: where the next instruction to execute can be found in the memory./starts at 0000h |
|  `SP`(8-bit)   | Stack Pointer: the location of the stack's tail. Initially, the SP register contains value **07** to point to location 08 as the first location being used for the stack by the 8051 |
|  `PSW`(8-bit)  |  program status word:**4 conditional flags** + **RS0„ÄÅRS1**  |
|  `CY`(1-bit)   |             there is a carry out from the D7 bit             |
|  `AC`(1-bit)   |               there is a carry from D3 and D4                |
|   `P`(1-bit)   |        odd number of 1's in `A` register, then P = 1         |



### 2.2 Addressing Modes

* Register Direct

* Register Indirect

* Indexed

  ![index-address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hujunhan/cloudimage/master/img/index-address.png)

### 2.3 Hardware

 Totally 40 pins

* $4\times8$ ports
* $8$ : `Vcc` ,`GND`, `XTAL1`, `XTAL2`, `EA`, `ALE`, `PSEN`
* default: input.  0 written to a port $\to$ output; 1 written to a port $\to$ input

#### 2.3.1 Port 0

An open drain:

* we normally connect P0 to 10K-ohm **pull-up resistors** to use it as an **input or outpu**t port 
* be used as both address and data, designated as AD0-AD7

#### 2.3.2 Port 1

Can be used either as input or output

* It **doesn't require** pull-up resistors because they are **already** connected internally

#### 2.3.3 Port 2

Similar to Port 1

* It must be used **along with P0** to provide the 16-bit address for the external memory. Port 2 is used for upper 8-bit of the 16 bits address

#### 2.3.4 Port 3

Similar to Port 1

| P3 Bit |      Function      |
| :----: | :----------------: |
|  P3.0  |        RxD         |
| P3.1 < |        TxD         |
| P3.2 < | Complement of INT0 |
| P3.3 < |        INT1        |
| P3.4 < |         T0         |
| P3.5 < |         T1         |
| P3.6 < |         WR         |
| P3.7 < |  Complement of RD  |

#### 2.3.5 Other

* `RST`: **Power-On Reset** To ensure a valid input of Reset, the high pulse must be **high** for a **minimum of two machine cycles**

* `EA`: (**External Access**) Applying a **low pulse**, it gets activated
* `PSEN`: (**Program store Enable**) Applying a **low pulse**, it gets activated
* Single-Bit Instructions
  * SETB\CLR\CPL\JB\JNB\JBC

### 2.4 Timers

8051 has 2 timers, `Timer 0` and `Timer 1` 

* Both `Timer 0 and 1` are 16-bit wide
* 2 separate 8-bit registers `TH0\1` and `TL0\1`

#### 2.4.1 TMOD

![tmod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hujunhan/cloudimage/master/img/tmod.png)

* `Gate`: the timer only runs while INT(0,1) is high. Control the on\off of the timers

  * Software: SETB TR0 \ CLR TR0
  * Hardware: `Gate`=1

* `C/T` : Counter/Timer select bit.

  * =0: Timers .Be incremented with every **machine cycle**
  * =1: Counter

* Mode

  `TF0\1` will be set 1 if Timer has overflowed.

  * 0: **13-bit** timer mode (8 bits of TH1 and 5 bits of TL1)
  * 1: **16-bit** timer mode 
  * 2: **8-bit Auto Reload** : Overflow form `TL1` set `TF1`(1) and reload `TL1` with `TH1`

### 2.5 Interrupts

For every interrupt, there must be an interrupt service routine (ISR), or **interrupt handler** 

#### 2.5.1 Process

1. **Close** currently executing instruction and **save** the PC in stack
2. **Jump** to memory location of the interrupt vector table and **execute** ISR
3. **Get** PC from stack, **execute** from that address 

#### 2.5.2 Priority

We can alter the priority by programming a register called `IP` (8-bit)(interrupt priority).

default:

| Interrupt | Priority | Meaning |
| :----: | :----: |:------------------------------------------------: |
| PT1  | IP.3 | Defines the Timer 1 interrupt priority level.    |
| PX1  | IP.2 | Defines the External Interrupt 1 priority level. |
| PT0  | IP.1 | Defines the Timer 0 interrupt priority level.    |
| PX0  | IP.0 | Defines the External Interrupt 0 priority level. |

#### 2.5.3 Enabling

We can enable interrupt by programming a register called `IE`(8-bit)(interrupt enable).

|   EA   |     -     |   ET2   |     ES      |   ET1   |    EX1     |   ET0   |    EX0     |
| :----: | :-------: | :-----: | :---------: | :-----: | :--------: | :-----: | :--------: |
| Global | Undefined | Timer 2 | Serial port | Timer 1 | External 1 | Timer 0 | External 0 |
