## 1 Introduction

**Premise**:  Know the means to calculate joint-position correspond to desired end-effector motions.

**Problem**: How to cause the manipulator acually to perform these desired motions.

**Solution 1**: Linear control system.

* In fact, non-linear is more usual, linear control is just a **approximate** methods
* It's resonable to make such approximation, so lineat control methods are the ones **most often used in industrial practice.**
* Learn linear first is good for later study

## 2 Control-Law Partitioning

Partitioning Method (2 parts):

* model-based portion: make use of supposed knowledge of ***m,b,k***, to make the system appear as a unit mass$\to$ servo portion simple.
* servo portion: make use of ***feedback*** to modify the behavior of the system

A open-loop equation of motion for the system:
$$
m \ddot { x } + b \dot { x } + k x = f
$$
The model-based portion of the control:
$$
f = \alpha f ^ { \prime } + \beta
$$
and we choose(because we want to make the )
$$
\begin{array} { l } { \alpha = m } \\ { \beta = b \dot { x } + k x } \end{array}
$$
finally we get   $\ddot { x } = f ^ { \prime }$

Graphiclly,we transform a system like this

into a system easier

![easier-system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hujunhan/cloudimage/master/img/robotics-lin-con-easier.png)

What we need to do is design a  control law to compute $f ^ { \prime } = - k _ { v } \dot { x } - k _ { p } x$

so it yields
$$
\ddot { x } + k _ { v } \dot { x } + k _ { p } x = 0
$$

### Conclusion

1. get the systemâ€˜s parameters
2. find $\alpha ,\beta$
3. calculate $k_v,k_p$ depend on the requirement

### 3. Trajectory-Following Control

Know: trajectory, a funciton of time $x_d(t)$ and we can get $\dot x_d, \ddot x_d $as well

Define: $e=x_d-x$

Design $f ^ { \prime } = \ddot { x } _ { d } + k _ { v } \dot { e } + k _ { p } e$

Get: $\ddot { x } = \ddot { x } _ { d } + k _ { v } \dot { e } + k _ { p } e$

So, we can choose coefficients and design any response we want
