## 1 Introduction

> Kinematics is the **branch of mechanics** that studies the motion of a body, without considering it's mass or forces.

A robot arm, a serial-link manipulator, a chain of rigid links and joints. Each joint has one degree of freedom. 2 types:

* Translational—–prismatic joint
* Rotational—–revolute joint

## 2 Forward Kinematics

## 3 Inverse Kinematics

## 4 Trajectory

**Requirement**: move the end-effector smoothly from pose A to pose B.

**Approach**:

* joint-space
* Cartesian motion

### 4.1 joint-space

### 4.2 Cartesian motion

## 5 Advanced Application
