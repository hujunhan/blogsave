### Introduction

Problem of the Listener: **Extract** meaning from the acoustic signal

* involves the recognition of words
* identifying the perceptual cues that listeners use

### Cues

* aspirated and unaspirated stops in Mandarin differ in VOT
  * Are listeners senstive to these differences?
* Most test: manipulate the acoustic property synthetically and see if perceptual response is affected

Properties of cues:

* cues combine to distinguish sounds
* individual cues can vary in strength

## Categorical

Listeners only have access to category labels, so stimuli can only be distinguished if they are identified as belonging to different categories

Why significant?

* the categorical perception pattern **contrasts** with the pattern observedd in psychophysical experiments using **non-speech** stimuli
  * This contrast was used to aruge that speech perception is **“special”**
