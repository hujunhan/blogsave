## Overview

Do we have an obligation to obey laws?

Political Philosophy is examine philosophical questions about

*  the **relationship between states and its citizen** 
* **relations between states** 
* **political obligation**

## Problem of Political Obligation

State make demands to us

* Taxes, Army

The **problem **is Why should we obey the laws

> Note: $Obeying \not= Complying $
>
> * Comply: do what the law commands, or they will be punished
> * Obey: do what the law commands because the law commands it

## The Grounds of Political Obligation

* **benefit** theory, can be divided in 2 parts

  * people benefit from state—clear

  * people have to obey the law—not clear,because:

    * does being benefited always **generate obligations**?

      No, if I do something for others, I get a “Thank you”, it’s not obligations

    * does being benefited generate obligations **to obey**?

* **Consent** theory: we've consented to the state and to having such obligations to it. Problem:

  * Insufficient people have given consent
    * Reply: **Expressed** and **tacit** (vote \ using public services) consent 
  * it only generates obligation if one is able to withhold consent
  * Too easy to avoid
    * Reply, it’s not easy to avoid tacit cosent
      * Re:Reply, many people have no effective alternative to remaining within their state

* **Fairness** theory: Citizens are a part of cooperative enterprises that are mutually beneficial and fair.

  * We’re born in states
  * We’re limited in our ability to leave the state

## What if the Problem can’t be solved

We should reconsider states
