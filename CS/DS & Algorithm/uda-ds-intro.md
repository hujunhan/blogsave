## Introduction

### Welcome

At its core, this program is about how to write code to **solve problems** and to do so **efficiently**.

The key to mastering these skills is practice.

## Python Refresher

Using Python3 to do the exercise 

* Control structure

* Function & Generator

  > A generator in Python is similar to a function except instead of returning a value and exiting a process, a generator will pause the process, saving its state for next time. The biggest difference between a function and generator from a code perspective is one word: `return` is changed to `yield`.

* Classes

  * `self` a very important concept:star: which is used to reference a class instance's own variables and functions from within the class definition
