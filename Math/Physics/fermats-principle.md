## 1 Overview

> **Fermat's principle**, or the **principle of least time**, named after French mathematician [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat), is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.

## 3 Solve with Mechanics

The main idea: Nature will make the system in some state that has **least energy**.

So we can just find out the point where the **forces balanced**
